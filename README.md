        tictactoe python implementation with minmax and alphabeta pruning.
        Project-1 Game Playing.
        Minimax Algorithm & Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithm.


This project consists of designing and implementing a program that plays Tic-Tac-toe. You should be 
implement using minimax and also using alpha beta pruning, and compare the results.  You can use 
any heuristic (evaluation/static) functions to perform the adversarial search. 
This project will give you more experience on the use of: 
1. Minimax algorithm
2. Alpha Beta pruning algorithm
Project parts:

Part-1:
 Develop an application to play a tic-tac-toe game using minimax and alpha beta pruning 
algorithm i.e., AI vs the player. (2 implementations – one using minimax and one using 
alpha beta pruning)
 Your program should allow the user to play and complete the game.

Part-2:
 Develop a function which takes a set of inputs from the 2-player game i.e., any state and 
outputs an optimal move for the player i.e., optimal state.
 Your program should also take an input set and provide an optimal move for that input. 
For  example,  consider  the  below  input.  You  are  the  "X"  player,  it  is  your  turn  to  move, 
and the current board configuration is shown below:

              |   |
              |   | O
              |   |
           -----------
              |   |
            X | O | O
              |   |
           -----------
              |   |
              |   | X
              |   |
              
Answer the following:
1. What will be your optimal move according to Minimax and also with Alpha beta 
pruning? 
2. Does both the algorithm suggest the same move?  
3. How many nodes does it visit?
4. Perform a hand calculation for the above set and compare the result with the program 
result. Is it the same?
